<p>I got my first computer in 1999. Before having it, I had an old computer magazine from 1997 that I got from my neighbor and a box of empty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#%E2%80%8B3_1%E2%81%842-inch_disk">3.5&#8221; floppy disks</a> to be used one day. I ended up with so many useless floppy disks that I was dreaming of copying PC games to them to play every night on my computer. And floppy disks were the only way that at least I could partially make my dream come true. Because I could afford to buy them and it was giving me a feeling of peace not to have a computer. Each month I was buying a floppy disk, a sticker, and a cover with my pocket money. I was writing a game name I saw on the computer magazine on each label. And imagined I was playing it on my computer. That was my monthly routine, and it was there until I had my first computer.</p>

<p>The computer my family bought came with a three-year-long unlimited internet pack, and that changed everything. I was still paying games, but I was spending more time on the internet than the games each day. And one day, I ended up in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815061737/http://genres.mp3.com/music/metal/">mp3.com</a>. I don&#39;t exactly remember if I was searching for music or something else, but mp3.com was a website for me to explore months and months. I didn&#39;t know any genre or any band; I didn&#39;t know what to look for, and I somehow found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphis">Amorphis</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuonela_(album)">Tounela</a> was recently released, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cArlZvFTEco">Greed</a> was available for download. I did download it, and it took a couple of hours with a 33.3k modem. Around midnight, I was listening to it. It is the first time I introduced myself to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal">death metal</a>. I had very mixed feelings while listening to it, but I was so hooked to it. I heard to Greed the whole night, and I didn&#39;t turn it off while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>In the morning, I searched for more bands and put more songs into my download queue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_All_Authority">Against All Authority</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock">punk</a>), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhqTKfg_yDw">Catholic School Girls</a> (punk), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ataris">The Ataris</a> (punk), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpIS0hy-XMQ">Punchbuggy</a> (punk) and some death metal bands that were available in mp3.com at that time -I don&#39;t remember the names anymore. My routine changed from dreaming games to downloading new songs from mp3.com. And listened to them the whole night even when I was in bed and sleeping. I do understand if you couldn&#39;t listen to death metal while sleeping, but I did it every night. Later on, it became a habit. This time I was listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death">Napalm Death</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore">grindcore</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal">black metal</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">Carcass</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(metal_band)">Death</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obituary_(band)">Obituary</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Angel">Morbid Angel</a>. And I was going to bed while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Greenway">Barney</a> was screaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1XhWVPVHzA">The Infiltrator</a> two meters away from my bed.</p>

<p>As time goes by, I found these kinds of music calming me down, making me very focused and giving me the power I needed during rough times. If something went wrong, I was listening to them. If I needed to vent out the anger inside me, I was listening to them. If I was happy, I was still listening to them. And they were providing free therapy whenever I was in need, which is something I couldn&#39;t ask from anyone. Did it work? I don&#39;t know. What I do know, I can still sleep with Napalm Death and feel refreshed in the morning while many people would possibly have a seizure from the very first minute. </p>

<p>From a floppy disk collector and a game dreamer to a death metal sleep therapy are such a strange shift and an exciting path. And I ended up listening to thousands of bands and tens of thousands of songs over the 20 years. And many of them used in my therapy sessions many nights. I am glad they exist! I am so happy they are louder, faster, aggressive and gives me peace. </p>
