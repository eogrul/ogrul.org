# Intro

Hi! Welcome to my playground for my ideas. I was writing these ideas for a long time and keeping them in my projects folder. I decided to share these publicly for free so that anyone who is looking for a plan to start working on can copy, distribute, execute, or improve them.

All of the ideas in here are free to share, improve, and execute. If you would like to get in touch with me, drop me an email via eren at ogrul dot org, or you can always invite me for a coffee (Amsterdam, Netherlands).
