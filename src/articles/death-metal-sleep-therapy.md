# Death Metal Sleep Therapy
#### May 31, 2020

I got my first computer in 1999. Before having it, I had an old computer magazine from 1997 that I got from my neighbor and a box of empty [3.5" floppy disks][18] to be used one day. I ended up with so many useless floppy disks that I was dreaming of copying PC games to them to play every night on my computer. And floppy disks were the only way that at least I could partially make my dream come true. Because I could afford to buy them and it was giving me a feeling of peace not to have a computer. Each month I was buying a floppy disk, a sticker, and a cover with my pocket money. I was writing a game name I saw on the computer magazine on each label. And imagined I was playing it on my computer. That was my monthly routine, and it was there until I had my first computer.

The computer my family bought came with a three-year-long unlimited internet pack, and that changed everything. I was still paying games, but I was spending more time on the internet than the games each day. And one day, I ended up in [mp3.com][1]. I don't exactly remember if I was searching for music or something else, but mp3.com was a website for me to explore months and months. I didn't know any genre or any band; I didn't know what to look for, and I somehow found [Amorphis][2]. [Tounela][3] was recently released, and [Greed][4] was available for download. I did download it, and it took a couple of hours with a 33.3k modem. Around midnight, I was listening to it. It is the first time I introduced myself to [death metal][17]. I had very mixed feelings while listening to it, but I was so hooked to it. I heard to Greed the whole night, and I didn't turn it off while I was sleeping.

In the morning, I searched for more bands and put more songs into my download queue. [Against All Authority][5] ([punk][19]), [Catholic School Girls][6] (punk), [The Ataris][7] (punk), [Punchbuggy][8] (punk) and some death metal bands that were available in mp3.com at that time -I don't remember the names anymore. My routine changed from dreaming games to downloading new songs from mp3.com. And listened to them the whole night even when I was in bed and sleeping. I do understand if you couldn't listen to death metal while sleeping, but I did it every night. Later on, it became a habit. This time I was listening to [Napalm Death][9] ([grindcore][20]), [Immortal][10] ([black metal][21]), [Carcass][11], [Death][12], [Obituary][13], or [Morbid Angel][14]. And I was going to bed while [Barney][15] was screaming [The Infiltrator][16] two meters away from my bed.

As time goes by, I found these kinds of music calming me down, making me very focused and giving me the power I needed during rough times. If something went wrong, I was listening to them. If I needed to vent out the anger inside me, I was listening to them. If I was happy, I was still listening to them. And they were providing free therapy whenever I was in need, which is something I couldn't ask from anyone. Did it work? I don't know. What I do know, I can still sleep with Napalm Death and feel refreshed in the morning while many people would possibly have a seizure from the very first minute. 

From a floppy disk collector and a game dreamer to a death metal sleep therapy are such a strange shift and an exciting path. And I ended up listening to thousands of bands and tens of thousands of songs over the 20 years. And many of them used in my therapy sessions many nights. I am glad they exist! I am so happy they are louder, faster, aggressive and gives me peace.
