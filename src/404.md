## This Page Is Not Real

The imposing figure with the trenchcoat shows you the two polaroids. One appears to show the Loch Ness monster herself in the middle of a stretch of dark water. The other shows a sasquatch picking it’s way through a dark forest. You look closer. The animal shapes are drawn on with ink. “This isn’t real!” You scream and throw the polaroids to the floor, sobbing.
