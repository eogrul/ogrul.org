ogrul.org is nothing more than a personal website that rants about life, technology, stoicism, and photography limited to the author's knowledge and experience around these subjects.

Furthermore, if you would like to sue me for any reasons, please send me an email. I will *DEFINITELY* ignore these emails. 

## Grammar
I often make grammar mistakes and welcome every help to improve it.
